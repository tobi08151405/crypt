# Teichicrypt
Is a python program for encrypting and decrypting files of any kind. It is **not** based on any other crypting mechanism I know.
## Requirements
Python ver >= 3.6, mpmath
## Usage
Just install using pip: `python3 -m pip install teichicrypt` and then import it, call `python3 -m teichicrypt` or just type `teichicrypt` into a commandline.  
Or download and run the `__init__.py` with python version 3.6 or greater or import it into a other script wich is running python version >= 3.6.  
When run as main, a tkinter window for easy usage will open, else use the subroutines as you want.
## To-do
  * Good documentation
  * implementation as command-line tool
  * ...
