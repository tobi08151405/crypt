# Teichicrypt
Is a python program for encrypting and decrypting files of any kind. It is **not** based on any other crypting mechanism I know.
## Requirements
Python ver >= 3.6m, mpmath
## Usage
Either run the pythonfile with python version 3.6 or greater or import it into a other script wich is running python version >= 3.6.  
When run as main, a tkinter window for easy usage will open, else use the subroutines as you want.
## To-do
  * Good documentation
  * implementation as command-line tool
  * ...
